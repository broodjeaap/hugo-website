<!--more-->
A game created during the [Game Design & Development](https://cmgt.hr.nl/informatie/minor-game-design-and-development) minor.
Source code was thought to be lost, but recovered by decompling an APK with [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) and refactored to work with a template project created with [libgdx-liftoff](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gdx-liftoff).

The game is available on the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.broodjeaap.escapefrommars).

Source isn't shared at the moment, because it's an older project, there are some uncertainties regarding licensing of assets.
